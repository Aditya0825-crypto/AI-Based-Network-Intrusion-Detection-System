# AI-Based-Network-Intrusion-Detection-System

** 📌 Project Overview**

Traditional security mechanisms struggle to detect modern and evolving cyber-attacks.
This project implements an intelligent NIDS that:
1]Analyzes network traffic data
2]Detects normal vs malicious behavior
3]Classifies different types of network attacks
4]Provides an automated, scalable, and data-driven security solution

The system is developed as part of the AICTE Internship Program.
**🧠 System Architecture**__
Workflow:

Network traffic dataset ingestion

Data preprocessing & feature selection

Machine learning model training

Intrusion detection & classification

Performance evaluation using accuracy metrics
**🛠️ Technology Stack**_

Programming Language: Python
Libraries & Frameworks:NumPy ,Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib / Seaborn
Machine Learning Models: Decision Tree, Random Forest
Development Environment: Anaconda / Jupyter Notebook / VS Code
